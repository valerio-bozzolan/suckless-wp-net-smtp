# Suckless WordPress NetSMTP bridge

It just allows your WordPress installation to send e-mails through a MTA, using the NetSMTP library that it's already packaged into your distribution.

This plugin is just ~133 lines of code. No crap.

## Installation

As every WordPress plugin.

## Post-installation

	sudo apt install php-net-smtp
